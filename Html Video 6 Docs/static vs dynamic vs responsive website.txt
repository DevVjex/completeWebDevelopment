Static VS Dynamic Vs Responsive

 ===> Static Website

Static Websites, also known as fixed websites
 are the most simplistic websites which contains
 web pages which with fixed content. This means
 their content do not change depending on the user.
 
Static websites are built using simple HTML code and
 display same information to every user. The codes are
 fixed for each page so the information provided on the
 page does not change unless it is manually updated. 
 Generally, static websites are cheaper and easier to create.
 
 Ex : Blog Websites
 
 ===> Dynamic Website
 
 Dynamic Websites, also known as fluid websites contain
 dynamic web pages that are generated in real time.
 This means that the web pages will display different 
 content each time the site is visited. These pages include 
 web scripting code, such as PHP, ASP or JSP.
 
 Dynamic pages access information from a database. 
 Hence, webmaster may only need to update the database
 record in order to alter the content of dynamic
 pages. Unlike Static websites, dynamic websites have
 more personal and interactive user experience.
 
 Ex : Facebook , Instagram etc.
 
 ===> Responsive Website
 
 There is another type for websites which is widely
 used these days. The websites which are built
 with percentages instead of exact measurements.
 These websites are called as Responsive Websites
 which are optimised for smartphones and tablets.
 Responsive websites used actually look different
 on each device. The elements stretches or shrinks
 according to the screen size. These websites are
 built using a mobile-first approach.
